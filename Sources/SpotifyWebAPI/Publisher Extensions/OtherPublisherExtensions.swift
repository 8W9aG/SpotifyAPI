public extension Publisher where Output: Paginated {
   
    /**
     Retrieves additional pages of results from a `Paginated`
     type.
     
     Each time an additional page is received, its `next` property
     is used to retrieve the next page of results, and so on, until
     `next` is `nil` or `maxExtraPages` is reached. This means that
     the next page will not be requested until the previous one
     is received. This also means that the pages will always be
     returned in order.
     
     - Parameters:
       - spotify: An instance of `SpotifyAPI`, which is required for
             accessing the access token required to make requests to
             the Spotify web API. The access token will also be refreshed if
             needed.
       - maxExtraPages: The maximum number of additional pages to retrieve.
             For example, to just get the next page, use `1`. Leave as
             `nil` (default) to retrieve all pages of results.
     - Returns: A publisher that immediately republishes the output
           from the upstream publisher, as well as additional pages that are
           returned by the Spotify web API.
