 * context: The context in which to play the content. One of the following:
   * `contextURI(SpotifyURIConvertible)`: A URI for the context in which to
     play the content. Must be one of the following types:
     * Album
     * Artist
     * Playlist
 
   * `uris([SpotifyURIConvertible])`: An array of track/episode URIs.
 
 * offset: Indicates where in the context playback should start.
   Only available when `contextURI` is an album or playlist (not an artist)
   or when `uris([SpotifyURIConvertible])` is used for the context.
   One of the following:
 
   * `position(Int)`: The index of the item in the context at which to
     start playback.
   *  `uri(SpotifyURIConvertible)`: The URI of the item to start playback at.
 
 * positionMS: Indicates from what position to start playback in
   milliseconds. If `nil`, then the track/episode will start from
   the beginning. Passing in a position that is greater than the
   length of the track/episode will cause the player to start playing
   the next item.
